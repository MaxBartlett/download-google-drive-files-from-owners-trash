This repository is a companion to a post on my blog, which you can find [here](http://maxbartlett.com/how-to-download-google-drive-files-from-owners-trash/).

To use the script, simply open up a commmand prompt on a system with Python3 and type `python3 replace_link.python <link-to-google-drive>`. The link should be of the format `drive.google.com/file/d/<id>/view`, or the script won't work.

Feel free to raise an issue if you have any feedback or suggestions.
